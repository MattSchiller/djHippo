# DJ Hippo Website
### Getting Started
To develop on this repo:
- `npm install`
- `npm run start` (to kick off the webpack processes)

### Site Content
The content for this single page app is and should be primarily supplied by config yaml files. This allows non-technical contributors (like dj Hippo himself) to update the site without a recompilation of the source code.
